Two types of posts are Ask HN and Show HN. Essentially, Ask HN is a type of post that asks a question from the Hacker News community. Show HN, is a post that shares something interesting to the Hacker News community, projects, videos, images, etc. \n\nIn this project, we will target two questions:\n1) Which of those two types of questions receive more comments on average?\n2) What is the ideal time for a post to be published, to receive more comments on average?\n\n\nThis data set is Hacker News posts from the last 12 months (up to September 26 2016).\nIt includes the following columns:\n\ntitle: title of the post (self explanatory)\nurl: the url of the item being linked to\nnum_points: the number of upvotes the post received\nnum_comments: the number of comments the post received\nauthor: the name of the account that made the post\ncreated_at: the date and time the post was made (the time zone is Eastern Time in the US)\n\nLicense of the dataset: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",
